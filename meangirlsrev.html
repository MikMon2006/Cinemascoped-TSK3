                Mean Girls (2004) is a teen comedy film written by Tina Fey that explores the complexities of high school cliques, peer pressure, and identity.
                The story follows Cady Heron, a formerly homeschooled teenager who enters public school for the first time after living in Africa with her zoologist parents. At North Shore High School, Cady quickly discovers a rigid social hierarchy dominated by a popular and manipulative group of girls known as the Plastics, led by the queen bee, Regina George, along with Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith.
                <br><br>Initially befriending outcasts Janis and Damian, Cady agrees to infiltrate the Plastics as part of a plan to take Regina down. But as Cady gets deeper into the group’s world, she begins to lose herself, adopting their attitudes, lying to her real friends, and eventually becoming as ruthless as Regina.
                <br><br>After a series of betrayals and a dramatic school-wide fallout, Cady learns the consequences of her actions. In the end, she takes responsibility, apologizes, and helps restore peace at school. The cliques begin to dissolve, and the characters find healthier ways to connect.
                <br><br>The film mixes sharp humour with a message about staying true to yourself, and it became a pop culture phenomenon known for its quotable dialogue and commentary on teen life.
                <br><br>I can quote this film easily just give me 5 minutes. I did hate the musical but I love this film. It’s like a Christmas film for me as much as Die Hard is a Christmas film to Jake Perolta. 5 out of 5 for icon status.
