                Ugly Betty is a dramedy television series that follows Betty Suarez, a smart, kind, and ambitious young woman from Queens who lands a job at a high-fashion magazine called MODE, despite not fitting the industry’s glamorous image. Betty, with her braces, quirky outfits, and big heart, often stands out in the cutthroat world of fashion, but her determination and integrity help her earn the respect of her colleagues.
                <br><br>The show explores Betty’s professional growth, personal struggles, and complicated relationships, especially with her boss, Daniel Meade, who initially hires her to prevent distractions from attractive assistants. Over time, they form a deep friendship. The series also dives into the lives of Betty’s family, including her father Ignacio, sister Hilda, and nephew Justin, as they deal with love, loss, and identity.
                <br><br>Ugly Betty mixes comedy and heartfelt moments while tackling themes like self-acceptance, ambition, and the pressures of beauty standards. Across its four seasons, Betty transforms, not just in appearance, but in confidence, ultimately leaving MODE to pursue her dreams, proving that being true to yourself is the most beautiful thing of all.
                <br><br>It was the will they won’t they for me, glad they didn’t though fr. Anyways, the way the characters are all villains in their own way is entertaining. Plus I live for the 2000s core that office has. 4 out of 5 popcorns for sure.
