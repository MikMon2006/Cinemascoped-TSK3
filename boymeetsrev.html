                Boy Meets World is a heartfelt coming-of-age sitcom that follows Cory Matthews, an ordinary kid from Philadelphia, as he grows from a curious middle schooler into a thoughtful young adult. Along the way, he's joined by his loyal best friend Shawn Hunter, his quirky and intelligent love interest Topanga Lawrence, and his goofy older brother Eric. Guiding them all is the ever-wise teacher and neighbour Mr. Feeny, who becomes a mentor through each phase of their lives.
                <br><br>The show balances humour and life lessons, tackling topics like friendship, family, love, loss, and growing up. As Cory and his friends face real-world challenges, from peer pressure to identity struggles, the series evolves with them, moving from the classroom to college and beyond. At its core, Boy Meets World is about the journey of growing up and how the people around us help shape who we become.
                <br><br>FEENAY FE- E- E- E- NAY. Yeah, I love Eric even though he’s stupid. Anyways, the show does send a message on a lot of real-world problems and I applaud them for it. The jokes are funny, and the line delivery is amazing. There is issues obviously, it’s a 90s show. Girl Meets World did suck though I can’t lie. 3 out of 5 popcorns.
