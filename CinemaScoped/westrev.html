                West Side Story (2021) is a modern remake of the classic 1957 Broadway musical and the 1961 film, directed by Steven Spielberg with a screenplay by Tony Kushner. Set in 1950s New York City, the film tells a tragic love story inspired by Romeo and Juliet, centred around two young lovers caught in the crossfire of gang rivalry.
                The story follows Tony, a former member of the white gang the Jets, and María, the sister of Bernardo, leader of the Puerto Rican gangs the Sharks. Despite the racial tensions and ongoing feud between the two groups, Tony and María fall in love after meeting at a dance. Their romance intensifies hostilities, leading to a deadly rumble where both Bernardo and Riff (Tony’s best friend and leader of the Jets) are killed.
                <br><br>As tensions spiral, Tony and María dream of a peaceful life together, but violence and misunderstandings lead to a tragic ending, Tony is shot and killed, leaving María heartbroken. The film ends on a sombre note, highlighting the destructive nature of hate and prejudice.
                You know, it really is a nicer version of Romeo and Juliet, at least it’s more diverse and less illegal when it comes to age. 
                <br><br> The first time I’ve seen it I fell in love with the characters. Yet, the rumble (which was a plot twist for me because I never saw the older movie) made me entranced with the story. It was the start of my love for tragedies. And I was actually surprised Chino and Maria are together irl, cause Rachel’s chemistry with Ansel was INSANE.
                Definitely a 5 out of 5 popcorns, imo, it’s better than the 1965 version as it is more authentic, and Steven Spielberg slays. The colours used in the fashion is tremendous and tells a visual story (I do miss the purple dress Anita wore in the ’65 version).
