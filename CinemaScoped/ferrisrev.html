                Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) is a classic teen comedy film directed by John Hughes. The story follows Ferris Bueller, a charismatic high school student in suburban Chicago, who fakes being sick to skip school and enjoy an adventurous day with his best friend Cameron Frye and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson.
                Ferris masterminds an elaborate plan to outsmart his suspicious principal, Edward Rooney, who is determined to catch him skipping. Meanwhile, Ferris’s sister Jeannie is also frustrated by how Ferris always seems to get away with everything. Throughout the day, the trio explores Chicago- visiting museums, attending a Cubs game, and even crashing a parade, while narrowly avoiding being caught.
                The film is known for breaking the fourth wall, with Ferris speaking directly to the audience, and it captures themes of youth, freedom, and the importance of taking a break to enjoy life.
                Watching this for the first time at 16, being around the same age as Ferris and stuck at home introverted. I lived my extroverted self through him and realistically I was the anxious mess that is Cameron. My love for this movie is beyond what I can comprehend. The way everything about the movie is exaggerated and extra is what made it great. John Hughes knows what he was doing for those few hours he wrote the script. It’s hard to hate Ferris and his antics when in real life, this would make him the most hated kid on his block. 
                Overall, I’ll give this a 5 out of 5 popcorns, the whimsy, and the way I wish I were him is extraordinary.
