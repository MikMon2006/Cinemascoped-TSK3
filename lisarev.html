                Lisa Frankenstein (2024) is a horror-comedy film set in 1989, the story follows Lisa Swallows, a misunderstood goth teenager grappling with the trauma of her mother's murder and the challenges of fitting into a new blended family.
                One stormy night, Lisa visits a local cemetery and inadvertently brings a Victorian-era corpse back to life with a lightning strike. The reanimated man, referred to as "the creature," is missing several body parts and cannot speak. Lisa hides him in her closet and becomes determined to help him regain his humanity by collecting replacement body parts, leading them down a dark and murderous path.
                <br><br>As their bond deepens, Lisa's actions become increasingly violent, targeting those who have wronged her. The creature assists her in these endeavours, and together they navigate a twisted journey of love, revenge, and self-discovery. The film culminates in a dramatic and ambiguous ending, leaving viewers to ponder the consequences of Lisa's choices.
                Lisa Frankenstein blends elements of horror, comedy, and romance, offering a unique take on the classic Frankenstein tale. It explores themes of grief, identity, and the desire for acceptance, all wrapped in a neon-soaked, 1980s aesthetic.
                <br> <br> Man, I’m living my 80s fantasy through this film. I’D DO MY HAIR LIKE LISA’S IF IT WAS SOCIALLY ACCEPTED. I digress. The film’s comedic horror style is amazing and who knew Cole Sprouse knew how to play a dead guy, wish they gave bro a name. I like that Taffy is the cheerleader type stepsister but is a sweetheart as she breaks down stereotypes. 
                <br><br> Man, the way they killed the people, especially the last one, was funny af. And the monologue before the last killing should be engraved on men’s brain because oh boy, did I relate. To clarify it is this: “You like cool movies and music and stuff, but only for you! You want to be the smart one who likes cool stuff, and you don't want your girlfriend to like cool stuff. Do you know how uncool that is?” ICON. 4 out of 5 popcorns. A point subtracted only because of the obvious exaggerated acting that kind of throws me off but IT IS A GREAT FILM.
